### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Angie and I am a Spanish teacher and translator. I am from Colombia and I lived in Madrid, Spain, for five years before moving to London. What I like the most about teaching is that I can help my students to achieve their goals through a variety of didactic effective strategies. I know that learning a foreign language can be challenging, so I do my best to set interesting and stimulating activities and resources. 

Every lesson is tailor-made according to your needs, personal interests, and specific level. I cover all levels (A1 to C2) whether you want to learn Business Spanish, prepare for your exams (University, DELE) or just improve your communication skills. We can focus on any learning aspect like speaking, listening, writing, reading, grammar or vocabulary.

I am very patient and empathetic by nature and I like to create a comfortable learning environment. Also, I like to work proactively to make sure you get the results you want. 

I offer a 30 min Skype trial lesson where we can get to know each other and talk about your individual needs and expectations.

Lessons normally take place at your home or in public places nearby, but due to the Coronavirus pandemic, IÂ´m meeting students via Skype. 

ON-LINE lesson price: (all materials included)
Â£25 for 60 mins
Â£35 for 90 mins
Â£45 for 120 min

Ask for a discount option if you want to book lessons in advance. 

Please feel free to ask me any questions you may have. I reply ASAP!

I look forward to hearing from you. 

Angie.
